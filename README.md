## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (with latest security patches)
- Docker 24+ (with security scanning enabled)
- Kubernetes 1.27+ (with pod security policies)
- AWS CLI 2.0+ (with IAM security configuration)

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository with security verification:
```bash
git clone --verify-signatures https://github.com/austa/superapp.git
cd superapp
```

2. Configure HIPAA-compliant environment:
```bash
# Load secure environment configuration
source ./scripts/secure-env-setup.sh

# Verify security configurations
npm run security-check
```

3. Install dependencies with security audit:
```bash
npm ci --audit
```

4. Start development environment with security controls:
```bash
npm run dev:secure
```

## Development

### Security-First Development Workflow

1. Create security-compliant feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/secure-feature-name
```

2. Implement with security checks:
```bash
# Run security linting
npm run lint:security

# Run HIPAA compliance checks
npm run check:hipaa
```

3. Submit security-verified PR:
```bash
# Verify security requirements
npm run verify:security

# Create signed commit
git commit -S -m "feat: Add secure feature"
```

### Security Standards

- All code must pass HIPAA compliance checks
- Mandatory security review for PRs
- Signed commits required
- Regular security dependency updates

## Deployment

### HIPAA-Compliant Deployment Process

1. Security verification:
```bash
npm run verify:deployment
```

2. HIPAA compliance check:
```bash
npm run check:hipaa-deployment
```

3. Secure deployment:
```bash
npm run deploy:secure
```
